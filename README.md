# Sample notes app backend (Web Project subject)

## Installation of dependencies

Once you cloned the repository in your machine, you can run `npm install` to install all the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

## Switching to different versions of the project

You can execute `git tag` to list the different tagged version of the project.

These will correspond to different phases of the development. For example, the tag `v0.1.0-lab02-end-part1` corresponds to the end of the _Lab 02 Part I_ slides.

You can run `git checkout <tag>` to move to this version. If you wish, you can create a new branch from here with `git checkout -b <branch name>` to continue the development from this point.

## Doubts?

If you have any doubts you can send me an email to my address at the UdL.
